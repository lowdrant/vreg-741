If you use this PCB, specifically the files used with PCBNew, in a design or as the basis for a design, excepting as an educational reference or example, I request that you leave my name on the circuit board and credit me accordingly for the design. Excepting any attempt to copyright this design, I place no further requirements or restrictions on its use, replication, fabrication, or any other purpose. 

The schematic itself is of a basic voltage regulation circuit, which I believe cannot be rightfully claimed as intellectual property.
